### Tips for exam

- All classes have to be canonical, but the exam's tester does only check for this matter on your *.hpp files*.. So, if you don't need to use some of the canonical parts, **do not waste time implementing them in the .cpp files** (for instance, overload, copy constructor...)

- There are many files to create on this exam, so in order to save time and avoid typos, it would be wise to copy them from the subject and use the `touch` command on terminal

- Same happens with logs or outputs messages, the exam tester can fail your submission if you miss a final dot on a sentence, so better keep the subject aside and *copy/paste all required output messages!*
